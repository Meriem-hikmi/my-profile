   	   Hi, I am Meriem, an 18 year old student at ESSEC Business School. I used to live in Morocco and now I live here in France. I love cinema, fashion and art, but also, spending time with my family and friends. One thing about me, I am a hopeless fan of documentaries and sci-fi movies 😉

   	   <h2>🎥Cinema🎥</h2>
   	   <p>
   	 	I have always loved cinema. Eversince I can remember, I was always watching movies. I became a huge fan of the culture surrounding the world of cinematography, especially international cinema. I love watching the ceremonies for the different movie festivals around the world, such as The festival of Cannes or the Academy Awards.

   	  <h2>📷Photography and montages📷</h2>
   	  <p>
   	 	Photography has been one of my passions for a long time. Creating pieces of art is a feeling that I find very rewarding and self-motivating. Since I am a sucker for cinema, I love making short films and montages. It helps me dive entirely into my passion.

   	  <h2>📚Reading📚</h2>
   	  <p>
   	 	Reading has been a part of my life since my childhood. Growing up, I loved reading classical novels, like novels from Jane Austen. Another thing, I love learning about history and documenting myself on impactful historical moments, like events that happened in history that have left a huge impact on our society today.

   	 <h2>👠Fashion👠</h2>
   	 <p>
   	 	I am a huge fan of fashion and clothes. I love trying on new trends and styles and reading about fashion icons. One thing that I also love is finding vintage pieces of clothing that I think are very cute and redesigning them to make them at my taste. I would love to learn to sew in the future.

   	 <p>
   	 	I love reading blogs about fashion. Thses are my two biggest inspiration in Fashion:
